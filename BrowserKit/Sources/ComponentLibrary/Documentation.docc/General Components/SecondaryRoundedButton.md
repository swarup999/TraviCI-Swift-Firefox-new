# ``ComponentLibrary/SecondaryRoundedButton``

The button which is used for secondary actions.

## Overview

The `SecondaryRoundedButton` is a subclass of the `UIButton`. This means properties of the `UIButton` are accessible, but for easy convenience it's recommended to configure the button title and accessibility identifier through it's view model ``SecondaryRoundedButtonViewModel``. The colors, rounded corners and spacing of the button although accessible shouldn't be adjusted and should be used as is.
