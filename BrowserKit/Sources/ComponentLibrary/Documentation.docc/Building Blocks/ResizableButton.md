# ``ComponentLibrary/ResizableButton``

This class is a button that enables resizing with dynamic type.

## Overview

The `ActionButton` is a subclass of the `UIButton` which enables resizing with dynamic type. This is a building block component for development purpose, and isn't the designer component in itself. See ``PrimaryRoundedButton`` and ``SecondaryRoundedButton`` for the designer button components. The `buttonEdgeSpacing` shouldn't normally be adjusted and be kept as is.
