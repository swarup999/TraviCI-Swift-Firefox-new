# Getting Started

This article is aimed at developers wanting to start using the Component Library.

## Overview

The component library is a Swift package that can be imported using the Swift Package Manager. Simply add it as a dependency to your project to be able to start using it. 

### Sample application

We have a Sample Application used to demo how to import and use the different component in the library. This library is at the [root folder](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/tree/main/SampleComponentLibraryApp) of the firefox-iOS repository. Make sure you have the Client application closed before opening this Sample application.
